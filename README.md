# IOTA PHP Library

## Development note

This library is under developemnt now and this library is not released any stable version yet.

So this will not be installed via Composer.

And it also exists some bugs/issues. Using this library is at your own risk.

---

This is the unofficial PHP library for the IOTA Core. (It's possibly be the official PHP library someday...)

It uses the PHP to reimplement the `iot.lib.js` library.

## Installation

### Composer

```
composer require iotaledger/iota
```
